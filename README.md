# AspireChallenge

Hi, Greetings! 

Thank you for the task. It was quite challenging and was fun to complete. 
*Note: Even added the application icon. To me it is the most fun past to give a face to the application/ *

Work done taking these reuirements in the Card Input screen.
- An API has been called to fetch the user details. I have used Redux-saga set-up. The name in the card is coming from an dummy API.
- A bottom tab has been used to complete the scroll animation. 
- If weekly spending is enabled the value and the process bar is shown and that value is stored in the async storage. 
- Rest of the fields are static.

Work done in the speding limit screen is done as per this requirements:
- Value can be inputted or selected from the otion and upon saving the tag - userSpending limit is turned on.
- It is turned on by a redux-saga action where i have saved that data in a async storage.

Here how it looks in iOS and Android respectively.
